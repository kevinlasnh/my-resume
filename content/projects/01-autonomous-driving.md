# Multi-Sensor Fusion Autonomous Driving Vehicle

priority: 3
type: "Research Group"
role: "Lead Algorithm Engineer"
period: "Jun 2025 -- Present"
url: "TODO"
tech_stack: ["ROS2", "C++", "Nav2", "FAST-LIO2", "GTSAM"]

- Designed and implemented a four-layer system architecture (Driver, Perception, Navigation, Global Planning) for an autonomous vehicle using **ROS2** and **C++**
- Optimized **FAST-LIO2** LiDAR-inertial odometry to achieve 50Hz localization and integrated **GTSAM** graph optimization for loop closure to eliminate long-term SLAM drift
- Tuned **Nav2** costmap and path planning parameters to achieve centimeter-level autonomous obstacle avoidance with LiDAR-IMU-GPS tight coupling fusion
