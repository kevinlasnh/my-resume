# Selected Relevant Courses for Resume

## Purpose
Curated list of 6 hardcore technical courses for VLA (Vision-Language-Action) robotics software engineer role.

## Selection Date
2026-02-07

## Target Profile
- Role: Robotics Software Engineer (VLA/Multi-modal Robot Learning)
- Focus: Open VLA, Vision-Language-Action models
- Technical Stack: ML/DL, Big Data, Distributed Systems, Software Engineering

## Selected Courses (Priority Order)

### 1. Data Structures And Algorithms
- **Module Code:** CPT108
- **Credit:** 2.5
- **Grade:** 86%
- **Period:** SEM2, 2023/24 Academic Year
- **Rationale:** Foundational algorithms for ML/RL pipelines, essential for all tech roles

### 2. Bio-Computation
- **Module Code:** INT301
- **Credit:** 5
- **Period:** Semester 1, 2025/26 Academic Year
- **Rationale:** Neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, RL theory - directly maps to Action modeling in VLA

### 3. Big Data Analytics
- **Module Code:** INT303
- **Credit:** 5
- **Period:** Semester 1, 2025/26 Academic Year
- **Rationale:** Core capability for processing large-scale robot demonstration datasets in VLA training

### 4. Advanced Operating System and Programming
- **Module Code:** CPT307
- **Credit:** 5
- **Module Type:** Optional (demonstrates proactive learning)
- **Period:** Semester 2, 2025/26 Academic Year
- **Rationale:** Distributed training systems, GPU optimization for large model training

### 5. Embedded Computer Systems
- **Module Code:** MEC302
- **Credit:** 2.5
- **Period:** Semester 2, 2025/26 Academic Year
- **Rationale:** Robot deployment and real-time inference systems

### 6. Software Engineering II
- **Module Code:** CPT304
- **Credit:** 5
- **Period:** Semester 2, 2025/26 Academic Year
- **Rationale:** Large-scale system engineering for production ML systems

## Excluded Considerations

### Excluded from Final List
- **Continuous and Discrete Time Signals and Systems** (CAN207) - Less relevant for VLA ML pipeline
- **Introduction to Databases** (CPT103) - Superseded by Big Data Analytics
- **Microprocessor Systems** (CPT210) - Too low-level for ML-focused role
- **Digital Electronics II** (EEE205) - Hardware focus not needed for VLA software
- **Introduction to Networking** (CAN201) - Less critical than OS/distributed systems

## Output Format for Resume
```
Relevant Courses: Data Structures And Algorithms, Bio-Computation, Big Data Analytics, Advanced Operating System and Programming, Embedded Computer Systems, Software Engineering II
```

## Notes
- Course selection optimized for VLA/multi-modal robotics roles
- Balances ML fundamentals + data processing + systems engineering
- All courses are from Year 3-4 (advanced level)
- Optional course (CPT307) signals proactive learning and specialization
